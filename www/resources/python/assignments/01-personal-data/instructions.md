In this assignment, you will create a Python program that does the following:
* Asks for the name of a person from standard input
* Asks for their gender as a letter 'M' for male or 'F'' for female
* Asks for their age as a number > 0

The program will then output:
* If the person is a male:
* age greater than or equal to 18:
  `"NAME is a AGE year old man."`
* age less than 18:
  `"NAME is a AGE year old boy."`
* If the person is a female:
* greater than or equal to 18:
  `"NAME is a AGE year old woman."`
* less than 18:
  `"NAME is a AGE year old girl."`
Where `NAME` is the name entered, and `AGE` is the age entered.

Extra credit:
Print the proper English language article a/an before the age. For example:
`"Johnny is a 9 year old boy."`
`"Bobby is an 8 year old boy."`
